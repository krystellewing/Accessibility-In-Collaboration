# Accessibility-In-Collaboration
Welcome to my Accessibility Repository! This repository contains projects and presentations that were completing during my time in my Accessibility in Technology elective during Spring 2023 and the Accessibility In Collaboration research lab during Summer 2023 under Professor Anne Ross. Below, you will find a brief overview of the content. 

CSCI379 - Accessibility -- Final Project
***Hilltop Cafe Web Audit***
The final project for my course in accessibility was to complete a web audit on a website of our choice, checking if the website was in compliance with the Web Contect Accessibiity Guidelines (WCAG) using web accessibility evaluation tools we learned in the course such as WAVE and WebAIM. I chose the website of a small, Black owned cafe I frequent back home in Los Angeles called Hilltop Cafe. In my web audit, I addressed the websites successes such as ARIA roles and heading usage as well as failures such as low color contrast and missing alt text on images.

Accessibility In Collaboration Lab - Summer 2023
***Miro: AI Innovation Workspace Web Audit***
During our summer research, web audits were completed on popular websites used by designers such as Adobe, Miro, and Figma to observe if designers and developers are working together to incorporate accessibility practices in the technologies they are creating. The Miro Design Web Tool Audit addresses the successes of keyboard navigation and ability to work with a screen reader, but also how Miro fails to contain alerts that suggest best accessibility practices. 

Bucknell University Kalman Research Symposium - Spring 2024
***Including Acccessibility into User Experience***
My team and I had the opportunity to present a poster at the Kalman Research Symposium in the spring of 2024. We presented examples of the web audits that were completed on websites used by designers to draw awareness to the disconnect that is occurring between designers and developers and incorporating accessibility. As accessibility is not always at the forefront when designing and creating technology, our research presented the shortcomings that are happening in the current tech space but also drawing awareness to incorporating accessibility.
